## ⚠️ I AM NOT SEALCENTRAL/SEALVM! These are just some simple scripts I coded that work on SealVM.
So, you're using SealVM and you only got a few seconds before it's someone else's turn. You want to download a browser because Microsoft Edge is trash, but you know searching for the browser will take time--time you might not have. If only I could run a script and let it install the browser so I don't have to!

Introducing SealScriptz, my new project. Just click a script from this list, let it download, click `More Info > Run Anyways` if Windows Defender gets annoying and the browser will be downloaded and installed! Now you can install a browser without taking so many turns so someone else can actually use the VM.

## Script List
### Scripts to Download Files/Apps
- [Download Brave Browser](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sealscriptz/scriptz@main/dl/brave.bat) - This script will download and install the Brave Browser (it's Google Chrome, but with an adblocker and access to the darkweb)
- [Download Malwatch/Enderman Malware Repo](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sealscriptz/scriptz@main/dl/malwatch.bat) - This script will download and display the Malwatch/Enderman malware repository as a ZIP. Do not run malware that violates the SealVM rules. SealScriptz and Malwatch/Enderman are not liable for any damages. If a pass is asked, it's `mysubsarethebest`.
